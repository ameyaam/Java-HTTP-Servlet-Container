Apache Tomcat like webserver and servlet container.
The web server is mutlithreaded with my own implementation of a blocking queue 
and threadpool. 
Capable of handling upto 10000 requests, 1000 concurrent. Tested using Apache's benchmarking tool.
Servlet container implements most of the methods that Tomcat implements in HttpServlerRequest and
HttpServletResponse classes.
